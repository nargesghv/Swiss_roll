With Scikit-Learn, PCA is really trivial. It even takes care of mean centering.there was some loss of information during the projection step, so the recovered 3D points are not exactly equal to the original 3D points.the reconstruction error:0.010170337792848549.variance ratio:array([0.84248607, 0.14631839]).By projecting down to 2D, we lost about 1.1% of the variance.
